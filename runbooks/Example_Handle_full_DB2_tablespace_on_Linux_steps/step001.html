<p>This runbook provides an example for illustrative purposes. Feel free to adjust the steps as needed in your environment. Then you can remove this step and publish the runbook.</p>
<p>Note: You can also use images within runbooks (like the IBM logo in this step). As a best practice you should use images with a resolution that is just sufficient to be viewed on a monitor. &nbsp;The total amount of data that may be stored as a single runbook is limited to 1 MB.</p>
