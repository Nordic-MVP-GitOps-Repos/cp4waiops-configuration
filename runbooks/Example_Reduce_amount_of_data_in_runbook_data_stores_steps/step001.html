<p>This runbook guides you through the steps to make a copy of existing runbook execution data and store them safely in another location. Potentially you may need this data for auditing and data storage purposes. The data that gets extracted while running this runbook can then be deleted from the production Cloudant/CouchDB database. This is beneficial for performance considerations of the database, as the database can query records faster. Additionally you can free disk space and prevent your file system from being occupied by historical runbook execution data.</p>
<p>This runbook can also be used as an example of how to use the runbook API.</p>
<p>As an alternative to using this manual runbook, there is also an automated runbook that performs the same task: "Automatically reduce amount of data in runbook data stores". The automated runbook is much better suited for productive use, as this manual runbook requires you to export and delete each runbook instance individually.</p>
