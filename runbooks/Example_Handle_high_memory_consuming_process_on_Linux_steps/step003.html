<p>Run the following command to display the ten processes consuming the most memory:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<section class="rba-command"><span class="rba-command-text">ps -eo %mem,pid,comm | sort -nr | head -n 10</span></section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result will display the memory utilization in the first column. Identify all processes with a too high memory utilization, go back to your runbook parameters and change the PROCESS_ID parameter to the number identified by the second column.</p>
<p>If there are no processes appearing in this list with a high memory utilization, <span class="rba-goto" data-id="end"></span>this runbook.</p>
