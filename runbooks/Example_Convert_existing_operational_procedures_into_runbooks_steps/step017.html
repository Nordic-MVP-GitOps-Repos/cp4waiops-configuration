<p>To inspect the imported runbooks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the instructions from this step to some temporary file, or take a screen shot of this step (because the next instructions will close this page temporarily).</li>
  <li>Navigate to the Library page.</li>
  <li>Select the tag filter area and select "converted-html-ibm-docs-rba". This is the default tag for the converted runbooks from IBM Documentation, as configured within config.js.</li>
  <li>Browse some of the runbooks that match the filter. In each of the runbooks, the first step contains a disclaimer that has been inserted by the conversion tool. You can suppress the generation of this disclaimer step within config.js.</li>
  <li>Once you are done, you can delete these runbooks.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the Execution page.</li>
  <li>Select the execution of this runbook that is still in progress, and resume it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations - you have successfully installed and used the tool!</p>
