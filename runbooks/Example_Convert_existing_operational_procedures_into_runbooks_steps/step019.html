<p>Read the configuration file config.js, and adjust the configuration values to your preferences.</p>
<p>The configuration file provides a default set of patterns. Each pattern defines a combination of HTML elements that are candidates for the runbook title and for the runbook step titles, along with further definitions that control which parts of the document end up within the runbook steps themselves.</p>
<p>To proceed towards getting the best runbook results based on your input data, you will probably need to evaluate the structure of your input data: What are the candidates to become runbook titles (e.g., "h1" elements)? What are the candidates to become runbook step titles (e.g., "h2" elements)? The comments in config.js guide you through that process.</p>
<p>Start with a small set of source documents that are typical for your environment, and tune the configuration until the resulting runbooks meet your expectations. Ideally, not many changes are needed, and the existing patterns fit your source documents nicely.</p>
<p>Use the same commands that you used previously to convert and import the runbooks from IBM Documentation.</p>
