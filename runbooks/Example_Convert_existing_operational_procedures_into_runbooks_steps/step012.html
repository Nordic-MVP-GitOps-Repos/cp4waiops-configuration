<p>The default configuration of the tool can be used without further modifications to convert some pages from IBM Documentation into runbooks:</p>
<section class="rba-command"><span class="rba-command-text">npm start</span></section>
<p>As the tool reads documents from IBM Documentation and attempts to convert them into runbooks, the tool writes detailed diagnostic information. You can modify the level of diagnostic output in config.js later on. Depending on the available network bandwidth, the tool may take some time to complete its task.</p>
